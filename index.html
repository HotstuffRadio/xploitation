            <p>And so begins the journey alongside an all-powerful yet unreachable authority and the impenetrable, totally illogical, convoluted bureaucracy and its workings.
            It was early morning when I. arrived. There was nothing out of the ordinary. I stood outside the glass doors leading to the building for a long time, looking up at what seemed to be
            a void, a very noisy, busy void.</p>

            <h2>Blog Post Day 2</h2>
            <p>Dear Applicant, Although we were impressed with your resume, we have decided to pursue other applicants who more 
            closely reflect the requirements for the position (You are not good enough for us). We wish you well in your employment search (REJECT! stamped on my forehead). Cheap furniture, Bright UV lights, 
            shiny happy people, busy, purposeful.eyeing the lifesized poster on the wall, emblazoned with a mustard yellow lightning rod, which I presume to be the company’s logo.
            The caption reads: Lightning Speed Communications, Because Speed Matters.
            Leaning back against the club chair, I anxiously await my name to be called.</p>

            <h2>Blog Post Day 3</h2>
            <p>For the first hour, I listen intently to ***, hanging onto his every word as he drones about **  and **, servers, customers, internet protocols, landing pages, log ins,
                error messages, covering every mundane detail under the sun. I find myself yawning appallingly, trying hard to cover my gaping mouth. ***’s voice is soothing; 
                hush and velvety, like a lullaby. By the second hour, I’m dozing off and my mind is miles away in snooze land with my cats leaning against me. My mouth hangs open and drool seep out,
                Gently, I extricate myself from the drool monster and rub my temples. Oh God. How the hell am I supposed to survive through weeks and then a year or so of this mind numbing crap?.</p>

            <h2>Blog Post Day 4</h2>
            <p>Day 4 of creaks by. M, C, T and I sit in the same seats, and the four of us have developed an
              easygoing, relaxed sort of comradeship. In spite of myself, our trainer V has quickly grown on me. He can be a tad
              ironic at times, which is great. He’s dull, witty, and everything nice, with an extra heavy dose of humor.
              He's a deleted cast member of Greek Friends. I’ve come to understand why V is training teams.
              Surely as the rest of this is soooo dull. And C has been a huge help. She picks up all the training material in a
              snap, aces the troubleshooting exercises and blitzes through the tech. As for me, I barely scrape through.
              I hate the pressure of cramming everything in, and having to spit it all out at a moment’s notice, so sitting next to C + A has come in handy.
            Whenever something is too ‘beyond’ Gen X, all I have to do is turn to C, and she graciously obliges..</p>

            <p>Did I mention how f*cking difficult it is to find work when your 60?? 
              Particularly in Greece where ageism, sexism, racism, ableism and of course, 
              homophobia & transphobia are all everyday workplace and cultural normativities.</p>
